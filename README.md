Discord bot that plays music

Some features are still in testing.

Before using the bot:

1. 	download FFMPEG - https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html.
	This will help us later to convert formats from youtube.

2.	Once downloaded, extract it and move it to somewhere you can find it.
	Then look up 'edit the system environment variable'. Click on environment variables near the bottom
	In the variable, click on 'Path' and then click edit.
	Click on new and enter the path it take to get to the ffmpeg folder

3.	In terminal, do pip install ffmpeg, pip install PyNaCl, pip install youtube_dl and pip install discord.py.

4. Make your bot on Discord Dev portal and get the token.

5. Insert your token in the main.py and run the bot.
